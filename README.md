# CS760-final-project

## Setting up the project
### Data
* In the data/.
* Download the [covid-chestxray-dataset](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset) and [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) in data/ and 
**name these folders chest-xray-pneumonia and covid-chestxray-dataset respectively**
* To reproduce the result in the report used the generated partition or you can also use split_train_test.ipynb to create new partitions


### ResNet-50 CNN
* Use resnet.ipynb to train and test the ResNet model similar to that in the project

### SVM
* Use svm.ipynb to produce the result similar to that in the project


**Please reload the .ipynb files it might not open the first time. It will eventually open in 2-3 tries though :)
